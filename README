FEATURES

It prints everything sent on the serial line of the arduino, as a banner
on Jimmie P Rodger's LoLShield.

<http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/lolshield/>

This code is intended to be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.

(it shall be checked out in a directory called "dispfont" or arduino won't 
compile it)

To generate new fonts, edit 'glyphs.lolshield' file follow the same pattern
as for other fonts. Then execute in your favorite shell :

   % bc glyphs.lolshield | python transform_glyph.py

yeah, that's weird... but that's why I kept it that way :)

then update the dispfont.pde with that code.

KNOWN BUGS

Fonts are ugly...

TODO

Improve the glyphs, add more glyphs.
Reduce flash memory footprint by checking whether some RLE or Huffman can compress correctly the glyphs.
