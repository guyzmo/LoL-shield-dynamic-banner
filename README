on Jimmie P Rodger's LoLShield.

This code is intended to be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.

(it shall be checked out in a directory called "testfont" or arduino won't 
compile it)

KNOWN BUGS AND TODO

 * Limitation to 13 characters maximum. Needs to improve the display function

 * I tried to use dynamic allocation for the displayed string, using malloc/calloc
  but then the program does not work anymore (it seems to be because of the atmega
  getting out of memory...).

  The solution I'm thinking of would be to reduce the memory footprint of the fonts
  sent to the arduino, hacking the font lib.
