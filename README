FEATURES

It prints everything sent on the serial line of the arduino, as a banner
on Jimmie P Rodger's LoLShield.

This code is intended to be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.

KNOWN BUGS AND TODO

 * Anything that is sent is split in two strings : the first letter, then 10 
  seconds later the remaining of the word. 
  
  e.g. : sending "FOOBAR" gives "F" ... "OOBAR"

   The only solution I found that correct this is to constantly write something on
  the serial line. But when I listen on the serial line with python, it's flooding
  the serial input buffer.

 * I tried to use dynamic allocation for the displayed string, using malloc/calloc
  but then the program does not work anymore (it seems to be because of the atmega
  getting out of memory...).

  The solution I'm thinking of would be to reduce the memory footprint of the fonts
  sent to the arduino, hacking the font lib.
